    <h3>Fun fact</h3>
    <p>As for my fun fact, I love cars and enjoy going to car meets and races. I grew up loving cars and enjoy looking at them. I find them as a therapy of sorts and definitely are my favorite thing. I did the Porsche experience for my 18th Birthday and found it so fascinating.</p>
